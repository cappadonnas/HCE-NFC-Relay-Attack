This Project is meant for developing a "Card Relay Attack" on the Desfire card.

[Requirements for environment]
1. two cell phones : one runs Cyanogenmod 9, another runs regular Android(or Cyanogenmod 9). Both support NFC and Bluetooth.
2. one Desfire card (a regular bus card maybe).
3. one reader (a regular ACR122U reader maybe).

[General progress]
1. One phone acts as a NFC reader, Runs CyReaderDesFireBluetooth apk. (OS: reagular Android)
2. One phone emulates as a DesFire card. Runs CyHCEBluetooth apk. (OS: Cyanogemod 9)
3. Two phone conneced with Bluetooth.
4. The APDU command that reader sends and APDU answers from DesFire card will be relayed by cell phones via bluetooth.

[Graph for relay attack]
"Bus card"(DesFire card) -- "Reader" phone <--> "Card Emulation" phone -- "ACR122U Reader". 

[Package Description]
CyHCEBasic : Host card emulation app, runs on Cyanogenmod 9. Reply to any input with dummyAnswer. No Bluetooth feature.
CyReaderDesFire : Card reader app, runs on regular Android. Query any card with dummyQuestion. No Bluetooth feature.

CyHCEBluetooth : Host card emulation app, runs on Cyanogenmod 9. Forward any reader query to CyReaderDesFireBluetooth.
CyReaderDesFireBluetooth : Card reader app, runs on regular Android. Forward any card answer to CyHCEBluetooth.

[Future development]
1. Add Wifi or 3G/4G connection option other than Bluetooth.
