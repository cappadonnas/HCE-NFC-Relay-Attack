This Project is meant for developing a "Card Relay Attack" on the Desfire card.

Requirements for environment:
1. two cell phones runs Cyanogenmod 9, supports NFC and Bluetooth.
2. one Desfire card (a regular bus card maybe).
3. one reader (a regular bus ticket reader).

General progress:
1. One cell phone will act as a NFC reader, and the other as a DesFire card.
2. The APDU command that reader sends and APDU answers from DesFire card will be relayed by cell phones via bluetooth.

Graph for relay attack:

"Bus Ticket"(DesFire card) -- "Reader" phone <--> "Card Emulation" phone -- "Bus Reader". 


Future development:
1. Add Wifi or 3G/4G connection option other than Bluetooth.
